# Week 11: SQL

<img width=600px src=dilbert5.jpg />

So far we've seen two types of languages:
1. **Markup**: HTML/CSS, Markdown

   Tell the computer WHAT to DISPLAY, and the computer figures out HOW to do it

1. **Procedural**: Python

   Tell the computer step by step exactly HOW to accomplish ANY TASK

SQL is an example of a **declarative** language.
In SQL, you tell the computer WHAT to COMPUTE,
and the computer figures out HOW automatically.

SQL is arguably the most important language for data scientists.
For example:
1. All interactive webpages use a SQL database to store user content.
1. Most technical interviews will do advanced SQL problems.

In this class, we won't cover advanced SQL concepts.
(That will be covered in CSCI036 and CSCI133.)
Instead, we'll be covering how to connect SQL to Python...
basically the "why should I care" aspect of SQL.

You'll need to know the following SQL commands:

1. CREATE: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp

1. INSERT: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp

1. SELECT: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp

1. UPDATE: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp

1. DELETE: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_delete.asp

We'll use the following reference for connecting SQL to python:

**Recommended Task:**

1. Before next lecture, download and install the `sqlite` executable for your computer at: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/

   Python has built-in sqlite support, but we'll also be using the standalone executable.

   In this lecture, we'll be using <https://sqlfiddle.com>, and you can use that website to practice the quiz problems.
