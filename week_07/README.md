# Week 07: More matplotlib + Syntactic Sugar

**Monday:**
Fall break, no class

**Wednesday:**

1. We will go over the following "syntactic sugars"

    1. list comprehensions: https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/

    1. dictionary comprehensions: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-dictionary-comprehension

    "Syntactic Sugar" is just a short way of writing common idioms in code;
    python is famous for having lots of syntactic sugar

    We've already seen some examples of syntactic sugar:

    List comprehensions are a famous and controversial form of syntactic sugar.
    They can simplify your code a lot, or make it difficult to read.

    In general: `while` loops > `for` loops > list comprehensions

1. We will continue to cover more common pitfalls with matplotlib
