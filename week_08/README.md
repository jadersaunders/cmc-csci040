The lecture will be based off of the following three sources:

1. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter12/

1. https://realpython.com/python-requests/

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

Examples of webscraping in action:

**Wednesday:**
We will go over the beautiful soup (`bs4`) library.
In order to use this library, you need to understand css selectors.
We covered this at the beginning of the semester, but you may have forgot.
I recommend reviewing the following video before class:
