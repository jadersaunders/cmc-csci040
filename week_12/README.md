## Lab

For this lab, you extend the flask app that you created last week to support login/logout functionality.
You should fully implement the `/login` and `/logout` routes,
and the menu should change depending on whether the user is logged in or out.

**Submission:**
Upload your completed python file to sakai.
You do not need to upload your templates or any other files that are needed for your code to run correctly.
