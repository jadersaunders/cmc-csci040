HW4
- Median grade: 29/30
- 18 students with grade >30
- 2 39/30
  1 41/30

- Very common to miss points on Task3 (1/3 students)

- 1000 valid comments was a deceptively hard optional task
  (only 4 students got it)
    - No one who said in their README that they would have completed the task
      if /r/BotTown wasn't banned actually would have
    - Reddit lets you only browse the 1000 most recent comments,
      so you had to have all your comments be valid with no mistakes,
      then run for 1000 comments

- 21 students did upvote/downvote, most with the TextBlob modification
- 9 students chose to do markovify/GPT-3

Overall Average: 93%


BotTown banned:
- Sorry :(
- Weird things always happen when working on "real" problems
- Good story for internship interviews

Main takeaway:
  On the internet, no body knows you're a ~~dog~~ bot
